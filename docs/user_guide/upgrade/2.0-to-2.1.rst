From 2.0 to 2.1
===============

As of ``2.1.0``, we've deprecated the original FoolFuuka installer repository and changed the folder
structure of the FoolFuuka installations.


Backup
++++++

You will need to create a backup of the following folders or move them to a new location:

* ``app/``
* ``public/foolfuuka/boards/``

.. note::

    Depending upon your configuration, you may not need to backup the ``public/foolfuuka/boards/``
    directory.


Obtain Latest Code
++++++++++++++++++

You can install the latest stable version of ``2.1`` by using one of the following methods:

Via Composer
------------

.. code-block:: sh

    $ composer create-project foolz/foolfuuka foolfuuka
    $ cd foolfuuka
    $ composer dump-autoload --optimize


Via Source Code
---------------

.. code-block:: sh

    $ git clone https://github.com/FoolCode/FoolFuuka foolfuuka
    $ cd foolfuuka
    $ git checkout 2-1-stable
    $ composer install --optimize


Copy App Files and Data
+++++++++++++++++++++++

You will need to restore the following folders from the backup to the same locations:

* ``app/``
* ``public/foolfuuka/boards/``

.. note::

    Depending upon your configuration, you may not need to restore the ``public/foolfuuka/boards/``
    directory.
